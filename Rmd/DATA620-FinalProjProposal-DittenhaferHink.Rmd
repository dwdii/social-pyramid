# Problem Statement & Research Questions

For the project we will analyze President-elect Trump's Cabinet nominations from a social and graph analytics perspective.  We will look at the network of relationships between the individuals as well as the organizations in which they play a prominent role.  

Additionally, we will attempt to unearth common themes in the descriptions of the above described entites from a textual analysis of the currated descriptions of them on Wikipedia. 

# Statement of Objectives

Using graph and text analytics, we will explore the individuals whom have been (or are expected to be) nominated for
positions in President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet.  Note: Since a number of these positions have yet to be finalized, these data are changing quite frequently.  The project will be completed with data current as of 12/11/2016

# Data Set

The data set is derived from an article written by Andrew Raffery and published by NBC News `r citep(nbcTrumpCabinet)`. We plan to augment this data set with web-based data including Wikipedia articles about each of the nominees and their organizations.


# Evaluation

##Graph Analysis:

- Basic graph analysis metrics will be extracted along with visualizations of the following categories:
  + Prior Organization
  + Prior Organization Type
  + Prior Position / Title


##Text Analysis:

- A custom library will be written that scrapes raw wikipedia content and converts it into a visual display of the most commonly used words (known olloquially as a word cloud)
- Will leverage python packages: 'BeautifulSoup' and 'wordcloud' 
- The accumulated text will be aggregated and analyzed for general language patterns (common metric such as Zipf's law)
